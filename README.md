## 📖 Abstract

The conversion of forests to farmland significantly alters ecosystem structure and function. This study investigates these ecological consequences by focusing on **nitrogen cycling** as a key indicator of ecosystem health. We employ a dynamic modeling approach to simulate nitrogen flow through forest and agricultural food webs, providing quantitative insights into the impacts of human agricultural practices.

## 🔬 Core Models Developed

This study is built upon a progressive sequence of three core models:

* **FENCM (Forest Ecosystem Nitrogen Cycle Model):** A foundational model using a modified Lotka-Volterra approach to simulate the nitrogen flow through a natural forest food web, establishing a baseline for a healthy ecosystem.
* **AENCM (Agricultural Ecosystem Nitrogen Cycle Model):** An extension of FENCM that incorporates human interventions such as planting, harvesting, fertilization, and pesticide use, allowing for the simulation of different farming strategies.
* **AE-FW-NCM (Agricultural Ecosystem-Food Web-Nitrogen Cycle Model):** The most comprehensive model, which includes a complex food web structure with multiple trophic levels, reflecting a more mature and stabilized agricultural ecosystem over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager

Installation
1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies.** The following commands will set up the project in one go.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/LUKEQ420/MCM-ICM-2025-E-Nitrogen-Cycling-Model.git
cd MCM-ICM-2025-E-Nitrogen-Cycling-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the analysis.** Our entire workflow is contained within the Jupyter Notebooks. Launch JupyterLab and run them in sequential order to replicate the results.

```Bash
# Launch Jupyter Lab to open the notebooks
jupyter lab
```
Once JupyterLab opens, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the files starting with `1_model_1.ipynb`.
